title: "YOLO"
description: "YOLO algorithm is a computer vision technique used for object detection in images. The algorithm was proposed by Joseph Redmon et al. in the paper 'You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection' in 2016. The algorithm is based on the principle of 'divide and conquer'. It first divides the image into smaller regions and then predicts the class of the object in each region. The algorithm is also able to handle multiple objects in an image. The main advantage of the YOLO algorithm is its speed. It can process images in real-time, which is important for applications such as video surveillance. The algorithm has some limitations, however. It is not as accurate as some other object detection methods. Additionally, it is not able to handle very small objects. Despite its limitations, the YOLO algorithm is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of applications."

## **About YOLO**

YOLO is real-time object detection models family.

As it said in the original paper for first YOLO model: "For YOLO object detection is a regression problem. It divides the image into an S Ã— S grid and for each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes, confidence for those boxes, and C class probabilities.

[The first YOLO model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf) has been published in 2016. Until then, many new versions of the model had been created, the most recent being [YOLOv7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02696ss), released in the summer of 2022.
