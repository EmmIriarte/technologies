description: "Redis is an open-source, in-memory data store that provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands. It is also a real-time data platform that functions as a blazing fast vector database, ML feature store, and data serving layer across a variety of workloads.

Redis provides access to mutable data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. These data structures can be manipulated using a variety of commands that are sent over a simple protocol using TCP sockets. Redis also supports various advanced features such as transactions, Lua scripting, pub/sub messaging, and bitmap operations.  


The solutions from Redis provide an additional range and capabilities to solutions built on transformer technologies. [RediSearch](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch), [RedisJson](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON), and other [Redis modules](https://redis.io/resources/modules/) allow for building the next generation of AI-Native software solutions.
