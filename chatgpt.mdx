The ChatGPT model has been trained on a vast amount of text data, including conversations and other types of human-generated text, which allows it to generate text that is similar in style and content to human conversation. ChatGPT can be used to generate responses to questions, code, make suggestions, or provide information in a conversational manner, and it is able to do so in a way that is often indistinguishable from human-generated text. The initial model has been trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using methods similar to InstructGPT, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. The model is trained using supervised fine-tuning, where human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sidesâ€”the user and an AI assistant. The trainers would have had access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses.
