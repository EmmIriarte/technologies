### Libraries
A curated list of libraries and technologies to help you play with OpenAI Gym.

* [Gym Library](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) Gym is a standard API for reinforcement learning, and a diverse collection of reference environments
* [OpenAI Gym repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) Gym is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API. Since its release, Gym's API has become the field standard for doing this.
* [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) Gymnasium is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API. This is a fork of OpenAI's Gym library
