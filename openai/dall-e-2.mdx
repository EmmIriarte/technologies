# OpenAI DALL-E 2

DALL-E 2 is a new version of DALL-E, a generative language model that creates corresponding original images from sentences.
DALL-E 2 has 3.5B parameters, making it large but not nearly as large as GPT-3. Interestingly, it is smaller than its predecessor, which had 12B parameters.
Despite its size, DALL-E 2 generates images 4 times better in resolution than DALL-E. Additionally, human judges prefer DALL-E 2 over DALL-E 70% of the time in caption matching and photorealism.
