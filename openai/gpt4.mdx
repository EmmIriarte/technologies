# OpenAI GPT-4
GPT-4 is an OpenAI's 4th generation Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a successor of ChatGPT. 
It is a multimodal large language model that uses deep learning to generate human-like text and it 
can accept image and text as inputs. GPT-4 is OpenAI's most advanced system, producing safer and more useful 
responses, it hallucinates less than previous models and is a major step forward. There are two versions 
with context windows of 8192 and 32768 tokens, which is a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3. 
OpenAI introduced the concept of "system message" that can be given to chat-optimized versions of GPT-4 in 
order to set the tone and task of the response.
