# OpenAI ChatGPT

GPT-3 is an autoregressive language model (LLM) from [OpenAI](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/) that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT series created by OpenAI. Currently in its open beta phase, GPT-3 has garnered significant attention and acclaim for its unparalleled ability to understand and generate human-like text. With an astounding 175 billion parameters at its disposal, GPT-3 stands as one of the most expansive and powerful language models ever constructed at the time of its release.
GPT-3's exceptional performance is not only limited to its sheer size but also stems from its highly refined architecture. Harnessing the power of deep learning, GPT-3 delivers consistently accurate and relevant results, elevating the standard for language models and establishing itself as a trailblazer in the field of artificial intelligence.

<TextArea full align="center">
  The ChatGPT model has been trained on a vast amount of text data, including
  conversations and other types of human-generated text, which allows it to
  generate text that is similar in style and content to human conversation.
  ChatGPT can be used to generate responses to questions, code, make
  suggestions, or provide information in a conversational manner, and it is able
  to do so in a way that is often indistinguishable from human-generated text.
  The initial model has been trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human
  Feedback (RLHF), using methods similar to InstructGPT, but with slight
  differences in the data collection setup. The model is trained using
  supervised fine-tuning, where human AI trainers provided conversations in
  which they played both sidesâ€”the user and an AI assistant. The trainers would
  have had access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their
  responses.
