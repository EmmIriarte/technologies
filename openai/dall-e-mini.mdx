# OpenAI Dall-e Mini
DALL-E mini is a small, open-source artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by OpenAI.
 It is based on the same technology as OpenAI's larger DALL-E model, but is designed to be more
  accessible and easier to use. The system is designed to generate images, text, and audio, based on text input.
