## Start building with OpenAI’s products
OpenAI has an amazing potential and extraordinary usage potential - we all saw the internet flooded with showcases of ChatGPT usage. Recently they introduced ChatGPT plugins. You can incorporate OpenAI’s technology into many of your app ideas and it will solve many of the problems you faced perfectly. To get inspired, see many [apps created with ChatGPT, Whisper and more during lablab.ai Hackathons](/apps/tech/openai)!

### GPT-3
GPT-3 stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 and it is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n series created by OpenAI. GPT-3 is currently in open beta.

You can easily use GPT-3 for your app, and all necessary APIs, boilerplates, tutorials explaining how to do so and more, you can find on our [OpenAI GPT-3 tech page](/tech/openai/gpt3).

### ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo)
ChatGPT is a large language model trained by OpenAI to generate human-like text in a conversational style. It is a variant of the GPT-3 model, which was specifically designed to be used to generate text in response to user input.

You can easily use ChatGPT for your app, and all necessary APIs, boilerplates, tutorials explaining how to do so and more, you can find on our [OpenAI ChatGPT tech page](/tech/openai/chatgpt).
