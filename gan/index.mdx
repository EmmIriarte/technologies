# GAN
GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) is a deep learning technique that can be used to generate artificial data that resembles real data used to train it It consists of two deep neural networks called generator and discriminator.

During training, the generator and discriminator play a game, in which the generator attemps to generate data that can fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to identify the real data from the fake data generated by the generator.This reuslts in the generator getting better at generating more realistic data, and the discriminator getting better at distinguishing the real data from the fake data.

GANs have been used for a variety of applications, such as image and video synthesis, text generation, and even music generation.
